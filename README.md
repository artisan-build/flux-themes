# Flux Themes

Some of our applications are "white label" type SaaS applications that we want our users to be able to theme to match
their brands. This package provides the functionality to make that happen. It includes:

1. Several pre-built FluxUI themes (using the recommended colors from FluxUI)
2. A customizable theme builder that provides color pickers to allow our users to set any colors they want
3. The ability for users to select from available themes installed on a particular site
